# Overview
This repository contains processed flare observation data for major oil and gas areas in the Lower 48 states of the U.S.. Data includes processed VIIRS data, satellite-estimated Flaring Volumes, state-reported Flaring Volumes both volumetrically and in their CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents. This data has been created by synthesizing VIIRS measurements with cleaned well meta and production data sourced from public regulatory authorities in New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota and Colorado . 

**Note:** Ongoing data updates and refreshes will be pushed to this repo.

# Important Note About File Sizes
Some of these files are over 1M rows and will not open in Microsoft Excel. You should be prepared to edit very large files, or else write code to manipulate them.

Data files are loaded into a Postgres SQL database given Excel file size limitations.
