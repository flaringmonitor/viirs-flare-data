# Overview
This repository contains raw and processed flare observation data for oil and gas producing areas of the Lower 48 States of the US.

The original white paper data is available under whitepaper/.

**Processed Directory** 

The data contains processed VIIRS data, satellite-estimated Flaring Volumes, state-reported Flaring Volumes both volumetrically and in their CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents. This data has been created by synthesizing VIIRS measurements with cleaned and organized well meta and production data sourced from public regulatory authorities in New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota and Colorado.   

**Note:** Ongoing data updates and refreshes will be pushed to this repo.

**Raw Directory** 
Raw CSVs of VIIRS flare observation data are in the "raw" directory. These are used by the viirs-flare-code repository (*flaringmonitor/viirs-flare-code*) to produce Flaring Monitor satellite-estimated flare volumes organized by Operator and by Basin.

# Important Note About File Sizes
Some of these files are over 1M rows and will not open in Microsoft Excel. You should be prepared to edit very large files, or else write code to manipulate them.

Data files are loaded into a Postgres SQL database given Excel file size limitations.
